THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

This is a hilariously bad font. You probably don't want to anyway, but use at
your own risk.

It is monospaced, so go ahead and write some code:

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	printf("Why am I doing this?\n");
	return 0;
}

fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
