# badfont

A project by me using my scanned handwriting to make terrible UI choices.

## Why?

Why not?

## Inconsistencies in the `*.png`s

I have been changing up specs and workflows through out working through the
alphabet. Please don't kill me.

## Usage

Download the font from the Releases page and... well, install it the way it
works for your system. If on Linux, usually `cp badfont.ttf ~/.fonts` works.

## Disclaimer

Has errors. Does not have many characters. Is inconsistent. Don't use it.
